    <h1>Sorting Algothrim Runtimes</h1>
    <p>
      <h3>Purpose:</h3> The goal of this experiment is to measure and compare the
      efficiency of sorting algorithms for sorting n elements. The algorithms
      that are examined are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort">Insertion Sort</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">Quicksort</a>, Quicksort with Insertion
      Sort, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort">Merge Sort</a>.
    </p>
    <P>
      <h3>Hypothesis:</h3> Quicksort is more efficient than insertion sort for sorting large arrays. The asymptotic time complexity, big-O, of insertion sort is n<sup>2</sup> while the big-O of quicksort is nlog(n). However, when implementing each sorting algorithm, quicksort has greater overhead than insertion sort and is less efficient than insertion sort for sorting smaller arrays. 
    </P>
    <p>
      <h3>Experimental Procedure:</h3> The runtime of Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Quicksort, and Quicksort with Insertion Sort (QuicksortInsertion and QuicksortInsertion2) algorithms where measured for sorting n elements, where 2<sup>3</sup> ≤ n ≤ 2<sup>20</sup>. There were 20 runtime measurements of each array size. Precision analysis was done for each array size by calculating the average and standard deviation of the runtimes in milliseconds.

      <b>Graph 1.</b> The average runtimes of the sorting algorithms for increasing array size in a log/ log plot. The slope for insertion sort is 2, which is consistant with a big-O of n<sup>2</sup>. The slope for merge sort is 1, which is consistant with a big-O of nlog(n). The slope for quicksort is also 1 with the constant less than the constant for merge sort.
