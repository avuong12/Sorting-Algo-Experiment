    <h1>Sorting Algothrim Runtimes</h1>
    <p>
      <h3>Purpose:</h3> The goal of this experiment is to measure and compare the
      efficiency of sorting algorithms for sorting n elements. The algorithms
      that are examined are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort">Insertion Sort</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">Randomized Quicksort</a>, Quicksort with Insertion
      Sort, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort">Merge Sort</a>. This experiment will also determine which k value, the value in which the base case condition is met for quicksort and insertion sort will sort the rest of the array, will provide the most efficient hybrid sorting algorithm when combining quicksort with insertion sort.
    </p>
    <P>
      <h3>Hypothesis:</h3> Quicksort is more efficient than insertion sort for sorting large arrays. The asymptotic time complexity, big-O, of insertion sort is n<sup>2</sup> while the big-O of quicksort is nlog(n). However, when implementing each sorting algorithm, quicksort has greater overhead than insertion sort and is less efficient than insertion sort for sorting smaller arrays. Quicksort combine with insertion sort would be the most efficient algorithm to sort larger size arrays.   
    </P>
    <p>
      <h3>Experimental Procedure:</h3> 
      <p>
      <b>Part I. Measure Runtime for All 4 Sorting Algothrims.</b>
      </p>
      The runtime of Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Quicksort, and Quicksort with Insertion Sort (QuicksortInsertion and QuicksortInsertion2) algorithms where measured for sorting n elements, where 2<sup>1</sup> ≤ n ≤ 2<sup>20</sup>. There were 20 runtime measurements of each array size. Precision analysis was done for each array size by calculating the average and standard deviation of the runtimes in milliseconds. 
      <p>
      <b>Part II. Determining k for Quicksort with Insertion Sort.</b>
      <p>
        To determine the size of the array (k) in which quicksort is faster than insertion sort. The runtime of insertion sort and quicksort algorithms where measured for sorting n elements, where 2<sup>2</sup> ≤ n ≤ 2<sup>10</sup>. There were 100,000 runtime measurements of each array size. The runtime for Quicksort with Insertion sort was measured, where 2<sup>3</sup> ≤ k ≤ 2<sup>8</sup> and 2<sup>2</sup> ≤ n ≤ 2<sup>22</sup>. Precision analysis was done for each array size and k by calculating the average and standard deviation of the runtimes in milliseconds. 
      </p>
      </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>Results:</h3>
    </p>
    <p>The runtimes for each algorithm is plotted in a log/ log plot as shown in Graph 1. The slope for insertion sort is 2, which is consistant with O(nk). The slope for merge sort is 1, which is consistant with  O(nlog(n)). The slope for quicksort is also 1 with the constant less than the constant for merge sort. Quicksort and both variations of quicksort with insertion sort where k = 8 had the almost overlaying trend for increasing array size up to n = 2<sup>20</sup>.</p> In Graph 2, the runtimes of insertion sort and quicksort shows that insertion sort is more efficient than quicksort at sorting arrays that are smaller than approximately 103 elements. The k variable was calculated from the intersection point of insertion sort and quicksort to be approximately 103 elements.

      <h3>Discussion:</h3>
      <p>The trend in the runtime measurements for each sorting algorithm at increasing array size, n, were consistant with the expected big-O of the algorithms. Insertion sort is not an efficient algorithm for sorting large size arrays as the runtime will increase by a factor of 4 each time the array size doubles.  </p>
